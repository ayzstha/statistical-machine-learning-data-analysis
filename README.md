# Statistical Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset  

This repository contains a statistical analysis of the Titanic dataset using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Logistic Regression** to predict passenger survival.  

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com) and includes passenger details such as age, gender, fare, class, and survival status.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling).  
- Implement and compare **KNN** and **Logistic Regression** models.  
- Evaluate model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC**.
